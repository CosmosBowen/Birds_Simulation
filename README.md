# Bird Simulation

This project is a 2D simulation of birds searching for food using Pygame.

## Features

- Birds move around the screen, avoiding edges
- Birds search for and eat food
- Visual indicators for bird's field of view and acceleration
- Toggle buttons to show/hide visual elements

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CosmosBowen/Birds-Simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Birds-Simulation
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
